Experience
----------
Jan 2012 - \ Present 
:   **Barclays US** *(Sr Tech Lead)*

    Barclays has a 2020 vision of increasing their customer base in US by 5 
    times of what it was in 2015 and servicing that volume on our existing 
    architecture and infrastructure isn’t deemed possible. So as part of 
    launching a new product Consumer Loan in US in 2015 the ask was to develop 
    a platform that can sustain such growth.

    * I	was a key member of the core group responsible for designing and developing 
    the platform and was given the responsibility of leading the effort for 
    payments module of the Consumer Loan Product.

    * My work of successfully delivering the Consumer Loans payments module 
    was recognized and I was asked to lead the effort to onboard Barclays 
    Credit Card product onto the platform, starting with Credit Card Benefits. 
    The challenge involved was to act as a catalyst, onboard, mentor new folks 
    and setup a whole new team of developers eventually.
    
    * Payments in cards space was seen as the most problematic area generating 
    most of care calls and was selected to be the next space in cards after 
    benefits that needed a revamp. I am currently assigned to modernize the 
    Credit Card Payments space and in process also onboard it to our on-premise
    cloud "a-Platform-as-a-Service".
    
    * I am currently assigned as the engineering lead for Barclays US migration
    to AWS. My role is to come up with a design and approach on how Barclays US can 
    migrate its application to AWS in a phased manner.  


Jun 2010 - \ Jan 2012
:   **PDX Inc** *(Sr Software Developer)*

    *   Worked on production support on their product Enterprise Pharmacy system, 
    a pharmacy management system which is used across majority of US pharmacies to 
    fill prescriptions and perform chain-wide drug utilization review.

Nov 2009 - \ Jun 2019
:   **Sungard (FIS)** *(Sr Software Engineer)*

    *   Primarily worked as a senior developer on their product Aligne that was a highly 
    configurable, flexible and modular multi-commodity software solution suite 
    that integrates trading, risk/control, credit, fuels procurement, emissions 
    compliance, back-office, treasury/finance and senior management information needs. 

Nov 2006 - \ Nov 2009
:   **Infosys** *(Sr Systems Engineer)*

    *   In my tenure with Infosys I learned my trade as a developer on multiple Java

    Comcast Cable (US).

    Added an enhancement to the Axon Framework to give keep-alive 
    messages priority over command messages by using JGroups 
    Out-of-Band thread queue. Otherwise under heavy load a network
    split was happening resulting in a false behavior.
