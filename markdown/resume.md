Experience
----------
Jan 2012 - \ Present 
:   **Barclays US** *(Platform Engineering Lead)*

    Barclays had a 2020 vision of increasing their customer base in US by 5 
    times of what it was in 2015 and servicing that volume on our existing 
    architecture and infrastructure isn’t deemed possible. So as part of 
    launching a new product Consumer Loan in US in 2015 the ask was to develop 
    a platform that can sustain such growth.

    * The solution architecure was two-pronged. On the infrastructure front we 
    moved an on-premise cloud based on OpenStack following industry leading DevOps 
    practices. And on the application front we moved to a Microservice architecure
    based on CQRS [Command Query Responsbility Segregation] pattern using Spring and 
    Axon Frameworks. I was a key member of the platform engineering group 
    responsible for designing and developing the platform and was also given the 
    responsibility of leading the engineering effort for payments module of the 
    Consumer Loan Product.

    * My work of successfully delivering the Consumer Loans payments module 
    was recognized by the senior leadership team and I was asked to lead the 
    effort to onboard Barclays Credit Card product onto the platform, starting 
    with Credit Card Benefits. As part of my role I had to act as a catalyst, 
    onboard, mentor new folks and setup a whole new team of developers eventually.
    
    * Payments in cards space was seen as the most problematic area generating 
    most of care calls and was selected to be the next space in cards after 
    benefits that needed a revamp. I was asked to lead the effort to modernize the 
    Credit Card Payments space and in process also onboard it to our on-premise
    hosted Kubernetes environment provided by OpenShift Container Platform.
    
    * Currently leading teams of engineers to build Barclays next generation cards 
    platform which will be able to support 50 million consumers with millions of 
    daily transactions. This platform is being build on CQRS [Command Query 
    Responsibility Segregation] pattern which allows it to be scalable because of 
    its non blocking & reactive nature, and serves the growing needs of our 
    organization. The platform will also allow Barclays to migrate its application
    that are currently deployed on our private OpenShift Cloud to AWS in a phased manner.  


Jun 2010 - \ Jan 2012
:   **PDX Inc** *(Sr Software Developer)*

    *   Worked on production support on their product Enterprise Pharmacy system, 
    a pharmacy management system which is used across majority of US pharmacies to 
    fill prescriptions and perform chain-wide drug utilization review.

Nov 2009 - \ Jun 2019
:   **Sungard (FIS)** *(Sr Software Engineer)*

    *   Primarily worked as a senior developer on their product Aligne that was a highly 
    configurable, flexible and modular multi-commodity software solution suite 
    that integrates trading, risk/control, credit, fuels procurement, emissions 
    compliance, back-office, treasury/finance and senior management information needs. 

Nov 2006 - \ Nov 2009
:   **Infosys** *(Sr Systems Engineer)*

    *   In my tenure with Infosys I learned my trade as a developer on multiple Java
    projects for global clients such as British Telecom (UK), Telenet (Belgium) and
    Comcast Cable (US).

Other Interests
---------------

Open Source Contribution
:   [Axon Framework](https://github.com/dhruv-pratap/AxonFramework)

    Added an enhancement to the Axon Framework to give keep-alive 
    messages priority over command messages by using JGroups 
    Out-of-Band thread queue. Otherwise under heavy load a network
    split was happening resulting in a false behavior.
